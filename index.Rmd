# Intro {-} 

![Understanding the Jamstack Cover](images/cover.png)

I wrote "Understanding the Jamstack" to help developers better understand the Jamstack architecture, philosophy, and
ecosystem. I have yet to find a comprehensive, project focused resource, that aims to help developers learn first hand how to build with this architecture.

This book is my attempt at being that resource.

Not only will you learn what the Jamstack is, but you will also build projects to gain a better understanding of
what is possible with it. In the projects, you will learn the various tools, technologies, and services in the
ecosystem.

Each project intentionally uses different tooling to give you as much experience with as many tools as possible.
However, I do not take a "deep dive" into each technology and service used. At the end of the
book, you will find a "resources" chapter, which contains links to articles, videos, services, and tools to learn more.

This book is _not_ for beginners. I assume you know, at the very least, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Finally, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this book. I have put in many hours creating it. It has been a labor of love and a passion of mine. I hope it will serve you well.

I would love to hear any feedback, corrections, criticism, etc. The book is open source and lives [here](https://github.com/robertguss/bookdown-understanding-the-jamstack) if you find any typos or would like to
contribute, feel free to submit a PR.
