# Intro {-} 

![Understanding the Jamstack Cover](images/cover.png)

"Understanding the Jamstack" was written to help developers better understand the Jamstack architecture, philosophy, and ecosystem. Not only will you learn what the Jamstack is, but you will also build several projects to gain a better understanding of what is possible with it. 

In the projects, you will learn the latest tools, technologies, and services in the ecosystem. Each project intentionally uses different tooling to give you as much experience with as many tools as possible.

This book is _not_ for beginners. I assume you know, at the very least, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Finally, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this book. I have put in many hours creating it. It has been a labor of love and a passion of mine. I hope it will serve you well.

I would love to hear any feedback, corrections, criticism, etc. The book is open source and lives [here](https://github.com/robertguss/bookdown-understanding-the-jamstack) if you find any typos or would like to
contribute, feel free to submit a PR.
