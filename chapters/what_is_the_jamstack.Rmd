# What is the Jamstack?

There has been an [increasing trend](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/jamstack) over the last several years to
break up traditional "monolithic" applications and architectures into smaller more maintainable pieces & services. The
Jamstack is a continuation of that trend.  The Jamstack is fundamentally an architecture, a way of designing websites
and applications. It is also a philosophy on how to build modern sites and applications.

It primarily centers around two very important concepts: [pre-rendering](https://jamstack.org/glossary/pre-render/) and
[de-coupling](https://jamstack.org/glossary/decoupling/). An important tool in the Jamstack architecture is the Static
Site Generator which "pre-renders" all of your content into static files, ie `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, etc. This means
that when a user lands on your site or application, the 'server', most often a CDN, renders that static `.html` file to
the user. This makes Jamstack sites & applications incredibly fast, secure & reliable.

De-coupling involves breaking up applications into smaller API's, services or systems. This de-coupling allows you to
create services that are single purpose and ideally do one thing very well. By having a de-coupled architecture you can
more easily maintain, swap out or replace those services. This also allows you to take advantage of 3rd party services
and API's which allow you to focus on the areas and domains you know well and let other experts handle the areas and
domains you don't. Do you really want to role your own authentication or ecommerce solution from scatch, or
would you gladly pay someone else to handle that for you?

## JavaScript, API's Markup

Now that you understand the two main concepts of the Jamstack, just what exactly is the "Jam" all about? The "Jam" in
Jamsstack is an acronymn that stands for JavaScript, API's & Markup. These 3 components are the building blocks of any
Jamstack site or application.

### JavaScript

JavaScript has exploded in popularity over the years and it is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It is also
what enables Jamstack sites to communicate to various API's and services. JS is responsible for the dynamic aspects of a
Jamstack application, which often seems to confuse people.

When people hear the word 'static' sites, they assume that there is not dynamic or interactive elements. This could not
be further from the truth with Jamstack sites and modern front-end ui libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, Angular,
etc. Jamstack sitess are static in that they serve up pre-rendered static files, however the UX can be as dynamic as you
wish, as you will later discover in the projects of this book where we build an ecommerce store and membership site.

### API's

API's refers to the services or systems used to build a Jamstack site, the de-coupling aspect. These are most often 3rd
party services, but you can also create and write your own. The Jamstack ecosytem is incredibly rich will all kinds of
services for accepting payments, authentication/authohrization, ecommerce, membership, databases, etc.

At the end of this book there is a resources section with tons of links to the various services and API's available for
you to build your sites and applications with.

### Markup

The last piece of the Jam is Markup. This ultimately ends up being HTML, but many Jamstack sites also make liberal use
of Markdown. Markdown is a simple markup langauge that allows content writers and creators to write content without
having to worry about HTML formatting, tags, etc. 

A static site generator typically takes this markdown and converts it to html during the `build` process where a site is
packaged up and prepared for deployment.

## Tools & services

While every Jamstack architecture is unique, there are a common set of tools and services you will often find among them.

### Static site generator

A [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) is a tool that takes your site and builds it into static
files, which you then deploy to production, usually a CDN. Often these tools take `.md` or markdown files, and convert
them to `.html` pages. These tools are also responsible for compiling JS, CSS, PostCSS, images, fonts, etc into their
production ready form.

### CDN - content delivery network

A CDN or content delivery network takes your site and deploys it to servers all around the world. This allows your
users, no matter where they are in the world, to quickly download your site to a location nearest to them. 

For example, let's say you live in the US and your site is deployed to a server in New York. When a user from Australia
tries to access it, that request has to travel all the way from Australia to New York and back again before anything is
rendered on the page. Whereas, with a CDN, your site will be deployed to a server in Australia and so the distance that
request has to travel is significantly shorter.

### Headless CMS

With a more tradional 'monolithic' CMS, the CMS itself is responsible for rendering the templates/views to the user
dynamically when they request them. Since a Jamstack site is pre-rendered, this is not possible. A [headless
CMS](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/) therefore is responsible solely for managing content, not the presentation or
view layer. They typically expose the content via a REST API or GraphQL API which a static site generator then extracts
the content needed during the build/compile step. Once the SSG has all of the content, it injects it into the templates
and outputs `.html` files.

### Continuous Integration & Deployment

Another important aspect of the Jamstack architecture is CI/CD. What this allows is for a developer or content creator
to automatically create a new build and deploy to production with the simple click of a button, or via a merge into
`master` in a repo.

Most headless CMS's will trigger a webhook when a content author saves a change which will then trigger the CI/CD
pipelines on the hosting provider which will then build and deploy the latest changes. Most hosting providers are also
configured to trigger a new build & deploy when a new commit is merged into `master`.

### Version control

A Jamstack site can be stored entirely in a repo under version control, usually Git. This allows a developer to easily
`clone` it and get the entire site or application up and running locally within minutes. No longer will you have to
worry about cloning a database or setting up/configuring complex local dev environments.
