# How to use this book {-}

## GitHub Repo

You can find the repo for all of the projects [here](https://github.com/robertguss/howtocode-understanding-the-jamstack)

## Images

Some of the images throughout the book can be hard to see/read. To see them better, click on the image, and it will
pop up into a lightbox at a much larger width and resolution.

## Search

The search feature in the toolbar at the top does not work unless the site is served over a server. The easiest way to
do this, in my opinion, is via an npm package called "serve." To install it run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
npm i -g serve
```

Once it is installed, open your terminal to the directory of the book and run the following.

```bash
serve .
``` 

That will spin up a local server which you can visit at `http://localhost:5000`. 

*Your port number might be different*.

Once you navigate to this address in your browser, the seach feature will work.
